Cleaning Data
============

Repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Page

For this assignment we will complete and submit:

1). A tidy data set

2). The Github repository with the link to the CleaningData Repository

3). A codebook that describes the variables, the transformations and steps taken to clean the data up

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  A full detailed description of the data can be viewed here:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here is the source data for the project can be located here:  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The run_analysis.R script will do the following:

1).  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2).  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3).  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4).  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5).  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Specific steps describing steps that were taken to complete the analysis can be located in the file codebook.md
